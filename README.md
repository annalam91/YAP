# Yet another portfolio, because why not.

Everyone makes portfolio right, what will another portfolio achieve, probably nothing. Or it'll inspire me to actually create some stuff and show it off, may even possibly complete some projects. Who knows what will happen to this. It may be left incomplete or I may actually utilise it.

## Created with:
* React
* Tailwind

## Things to do:
- [ ] Make more projects to flesh out the "portfolio" section
- [ ] Update the About me with real data
- [ ] Publish site.
